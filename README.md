*Codes and data used for the Master Thesis paper, "A counterfactual analysis of Korean Telecommunication Market"* 

This paper is a counterfactual analysis of the Korean telecommunication service market. 
Referring to Goolsbee and Petrin (2004), I analyzed in my master’s thesis how hypothetical policy changes would affect cell phone plan prices in the Korean telecommunication market. 
Specifically, using Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes’ (1995) method, I estimated the structural demand on telecommunication services and predicted plan prices that would result if the regulation on a market-dominating service provider is repealed. 
I also predicted price changes in response to the adoption of a new government-led cell phone plan. I found that the impacts of both policy changes would be similar, in that average prices would decrease, but I found that the details of each change would be different. 
While abolishing the regulation would lead to larger falls in the prices of expensive plans than cheap ones, introduction of a government-led plan would lead to greater decreases in the prices of cheap plans. 
Based on these results, I concluded that setting a specific policy target and considering proposals’ distributive consequences are important before imposing a change in policy.
